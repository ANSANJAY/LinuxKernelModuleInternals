**Section 1: Explain the technical concept**

üìö **GCC Attribute `alias`**:

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) provides several attributes that allow developers to customize how their code is compiled and linked. One such attribute is `alias`, which is particularly useful for providing alternative names (or aliases) for symbols, such as functions or variables.

Using the `alias` attribute, one can make `symbol_B` an alias to `symbol_A`. This means that, in the binary code, references to `symbol_B` will resolve to `symbol_A`.

**Syntax**:
```c
__attribute__((alias("original_symbol_name")))
```

**Example**:
```c
void original_function() {
    // some code here
}

void __attribute__((alias("original_function"))) alias_function;
```

In this example, `alias_function` is an alias for `original_function`. Any calls to `alias_function` will redirect to `original_function`.

**Section 2: Technical Interview Questions & Answers**

‚ùì **Question 1**: What is the primary use of the `alias` attribute in GCC?

üìù **Answer**: The `alias` attribute in GCC is used to specify alternative names (or aliases) for symbols, allowing developers to reference a function or variable using different names. This can be particularly useful for maintaining backward compatibility or providing different symbol names for different use cases.

‚ùì **Question 2**: Can an alias symbol have its own definition separate from the original symbol?

üìù **Answer**: No, an alias symbol doesn't have its own separate definition. It merely provides a new name that points to the original symbol's definition. When you reference the alias, it redirects to the original symbol.

‚ùì **Question 3**: How would you declare an alias for a global variable named `globalVar` with the alias name `gVar`?

üìù **Answer**: You would use the following declaration:
```c
extern int globalVar;
int __attribute__((alias("globalVar"))) gVar;
```

**Section 3: Simplify the concept**

üåü **In Simple Words**:

Imagine you have a popular caf√© named "Coffee Central". As time goes on, you decide to also refer to your caf√© as "CC" for short, especially for some branding or marketing purposes. Now, "CC" isn't a separate caf√© but just another name for "Coffee Central". If someone wants to visit "CC", they're essentially visiting "Coffee Central".

Similarly, in GCC, using the `alias` attribute, you can give a function (like our caf√©) another name without creating a whole new function. When someone uses this new name in code, they're still accessing the original function. ‚òïüëç

GCC Attribute alias allows you to specify multiple aliases(other names) for a symbol (function/variable).
