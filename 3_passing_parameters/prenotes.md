**Section 1: Explain the technical concept**

üìö **Kernel Module Parameters**:

In Linux kernel programming, just like how command-line parameters (`argc/argv`) give flexibility in C programs, kernel modules can also receive parameters at insertion time using `module_param` macro. This enhances the module's versatility.

- **Advantages**:
  
  - It grants adaptability, so a single driver/module can have multiple behaviors based on the supplied parameters.
  
  - You can configure things like I/O addresses, enabling/disabling debugging logs, setting operating modes, etc., without recompiling the module.

üñ•Ô∏è **Using `module_param` Macro**:

`module_param` allows kernel modules to accept command-line parameters. Its usage is as follows:

- **name**: Name of the variable. This is how the parameter will be recognized when you use `insmod` or `modprobe`.

- **type**: Type of the variable. The kernel provides predefined types to interpret the data correctly.

- **perm**: Determines the permissions of the corresponding entry in sysfs. It can control who can view or modify this parameter once the module is loaded.

For instance, if you have a module parameter like this:
```
int my_address = 0;
module_param(my_address, int, S_IRUGO);
```
You can load the module and set this parameter with:
```
insmod my_module.ko my_address=5
```

**Section 2: Technical Interview Questions & Answers**

‚ùì **Question 1**: What is the purpose of passing parameters to a kernel module?

üìù **Answer**: Passing parameters to a kernel module allows users to configure and adjust its behavior without modifying the code or recompiling. It offers flexibility, making it possible for the module to adapt to various situations, such as different I/O addresses, enabling debug logs, or setting different operational modes.

‚ùì **Question 2**: How does the `perm` argument in `module_param` affect the module parameter once it's loaded?

üìù **Answer**: The `perm` argument in `module_param` sets the permissions for the module parameter's entry in sysfs. This determines who can read or modify the parameter. For instance, a permission of `S_IRUGO` allows any user to read the parameter, while a permission of `0` means the parameter won't have a sysfs entry at all.

‚ùì **Question 3**: If a kernel module has a `charp` parameter type, what kind of data is it expecting?

üìù **Answer**: A `charp` parameter type in a kernel module expects a character pointer, which typically means it's expecting a string.

**Section 3: Simplify the concept**

üåü **In Simple Words**:

Think of a kitchen blender üçπ. This blender has buttons for different modes like "Pulse", "Grind", "Blend", etc. You can also adjust the speed or decide whether to see the blending process (like a debug log). Instead of having different blenders for each task, you have one blender with various settings you can adjust.

Similarly, with `module_param`, you have one kernel module, but you can adjust its behavior based on the "settings" (parameters) you provide when you load it. It's like choosing the blending mode and speed before hitting the start button!



----
In C Programs, we pass command line parameters through argc/argv. 

Kernel programming also allows us to pass command line parameters.

The command line parameters provides a single linux driver to do multiple things, for example

	instead of fixing to a single I/O address for read/write, it can provide that as command line argument and allow user to read/write any address. 

	Enable/disable debug logs/printk

	Allow user to set the mode if the driver supports multiple modes


=========================================
How to pass Parameters to modules?
=========================================

We can add parameters using module_param macro. Declared in moduleparam.h file

#define module_param(name, type, perm)              \
    module_param_named(name, name, type, perm)

name: name of the variable
type: Type of the Variable. Supported types are charp, bool, invbool, int, long, short, uint, ulong, ushort
perm: Permissions for the sysfs entry.  
E.g. S_IRUGO : Only read by all users
       0 : No sysfs entry
You can also use numeric values like 0644 for permission entry.
