**Section 1: Explain the technical concept**

📚 **Handling Quotes in the Shell**:

The shell (like `bash` or `sh`) has specific behaviors when it comes to interpreting quotes. Double quotes (`" "`) allow for variable expansion and command substitution, but they don't prevent word splitting (which is caused by spaces). On the other hand, single quotes (`' '`) prevent both variable expansion and word splitting.

When you use:
```
insmod argument.ko name='"Linux World"'
```
The inner double quotes are preserved by the outer single quotes. This results in the entire string, including the double quotes, being passed to `insmod` as one argument. `insmod` then gets the argument as `name="Linux World"`, preserving the space.

**Section 2: Technical Interview Questions & Answers**

❓ **Question 1**: What is the difference between using double quotes and single quotes in the shell?

📝 **Answer**: In the shell, double quotes allow for variable expansion and command substitution but do not prevent word splitting due to spaces. Single quotes, on the other hand, prevent both variable expansion and word splitting, treating everything between them as a literal string.

❓ **Question 2**: How would the shell interpret the following command? `echo '$HOME and "Hello World"'`

📝 **Answer**: The shell would print the literal string `$HOME and "Hello World"`, without expanding `$HOME` to the user's home directory because everything inside the single quotes is treated as a literal string.

❓ **Question 3**: Why might you want to use both single and double quotes together in a shell command, as seen in the `insmod` example?

📝 **Answer**: Using both single and double quotes together can be helpful when you want to preserve certain characters (like spaces) using double quotes, but also ensure that the entire argument is treated as a single unit by the shell. The outer single quotes ensure the entire string is passed as one argument, while the inner double quotes preserve the structure of the string.

**Section 3: Simplify the concept**

🌟 **In Simple Words**:

Imagine you're mailing a package 📦. You place an item (let's say a toy) inside a smaller box (representing the double quotes). You then put this smaller box inside a larger box (representing the single quotes) for extra protection.

In this scenario, the small box (double quotes) makes sure the toy stays intact, while the large box (single quotes) ensures everything stays together during delivery. Similarly, in the command, the inner double quotes keep the space intact in "Linux World", while the outer single quotes ensure the entire string is passed as one piece to `insmod`. 📬🎁

-----

This happens because shell removes double quotes and pass it to insmod, to avoid this add a single quotes over the string.

Run the following command: "insmod argument.ko name='"Linux World"' to pass the whole string
