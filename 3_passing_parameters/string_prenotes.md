**Section 1: Explain the technical concept**

📚 **Passing Arguments to Kernel Modules**:

When you load a kernel module using `insmod`, you can also pass arguments to the module. These arguments typically modify the module's behavior at runtime.

For instance, consider that a module `argument.ko` has a module parameter called `name`. You can provide a value to this parameter while loading the module.

However, spaces in command line arguments can be interpreted as the start of a new argument. So, when you run:
```
insmod argument.ko name="Linux World"
```
The shell treats "Linux World" as two separate arguments because of the space. As a result, the kernel only recognizes `name="Linux` and the second word `World` is seen as an unknown parameter, thus causing the error in `dmesg`.

**Section 2: Technical Interview Questions & Answers**

❓ **Question 1**: How can you pass a string with spaces as an argument to a kernel module using `insmod`?

📝 **Answer**: To pass a string with spaces as an argument to a kernel module, you can enclose the entire argument (both the parameter name and its value) in single quotes. Like this:
```
insmod argument.ko 'name=Linux World'
```

❓ **Question 2**: Why do spaces in command line arguments cause issues when loading kernel modules with `insmod`?

📝 **Answer**: Spaces are typically used to separate different command line arguments. So, when a space is encountered without any encapsulation (like quotes), the shell interprets it as the beginning of a new argument, leading to potential misinterpretation of the intended input.

❓ **Question 3**: If a kernel module does not recognize a passed parameter, how does the module usually handle it?

📝 **Answer**: If a kernel module doesn't recognize a passed parameter, it generally ignores it and may log an error or warning message in `dmesg` indicating the unrecognized parameter.

**Section 3: Simplify the concept**

🌟 **In Simple Words**:

Imagine you're trying to send a text message to a friend, saying: "Let's meet at the park." But you accidentally send two separate messages: "Let's meet at" and "the park". Your friend might be confused because the second message doesn't make sense on its own.

Similarly, when you use `insmod` and put a space in the argument without proper encapsulation, the command sees it as two separate messages. To make sure your full message (or command) is understood as intended, you need to wrap it up (in quotes) so it's received as one complete instruction.📱✉️

----
If we run the following command: "insmod argument.ko name="Linux World"
We get the error "Unknown parameter 'World' ignored" in dmesg
